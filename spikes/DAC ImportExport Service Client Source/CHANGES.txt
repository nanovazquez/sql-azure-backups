VERSION 1.1.0
*************

Added this change text file.
-DROP no longer accepts an argument for the database to drop.  You must specify -d to indicate the database.  This is to be consistent with actions that all require -d for setting the database.

EXTRACT added as an option to extract only the schema from a database.  Uses the DAC Extract operation.
	Extract is used to pull only the schema from the database, no data is put into the target file.

DEPLOY added as an option to deploy only the schema.  Uses the DAC Deploy operation.
	Deploy is used to push only schema to a server, no data is loaded into the target database.

Added the date and time to the events being logged on the console. 
Added a ReadKey if an unhandled exception occurs to make it easier to see the error message and stack.
